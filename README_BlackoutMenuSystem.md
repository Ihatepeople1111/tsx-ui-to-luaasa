## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Colors and Styling
Edit the `UI.COLORS` table in `BlackoutGameSettings.lua`:

```lua
COLORS = {
    BACKGROUND = {0, 0, 0},          -- Pure black
    PANEL = {17, 17, 17},            -- Dark gray panels
    PRIMARY = {220, 38, 38},         -- Red accent
    SECONDARY = {59, 130, 246},      -- Blue accent
    SUCCESS = {34, 197, 94},         -- Green
    WARNING = {234, 179, 8},         -- Yellow
    WHITE = {255, 255, 255},         -- White text
    GRAY = {128, 128, 128}           -- Gray text
}
```

### Animation Settings
Modify timing and easing in `UI.ANIMATIONS`:

```lua
ANIMATIONS = {
    TWEEN_TIME = 0.3,               -- Button animations
    FADE_TIME = 0.5,                -- Fade transitions
    GLOW_TIME = 1.0,                -- Glow effects
    EASING_STYLE = Enum.EasingStyle.Quart,
    EASING_DIRECTION = Enum.EasingDirection.Out
}
```

### Game Mode Settings
Customize each mode in their respective sections:

```lua
SURVIVAL = {
    SINGLE_PLAYER = {
        MAX_WAVES = 50,
        STARTING_ZOMBIES = 10,
        ZOMBIE_INCREASE_PER_WAVE = 5,
        STARTING_COINS = 1000
    }
}
```

```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Menu not appearing**:
- Check that LocalScript is in StarterGui or StarterPlayerScripts
- Verify ModuleScript is in ReplicatedStorage
- Check for script errors in Developer Console

**Teleportation not working**:
- Verify Place IDs are correct in `BlackoutGameSettings`
- Check that target places exist and are published
- Ensure server script has proper permissions

**Buttons not responsive**:
- Check if GUI elements are properly layered
- Verify ZIndex and parent relationships
- Test with different screen resolutions

**Party system errors**:
- Ensure RemoteEvents are properly created
- Check server script for connection issues
- Verify party data structures

### Performance Tips

1. **Optimize animations**: Reduce tween count for lower-end devices
2. **Limit particle effects**: Disable complex visual effects on mobile
3. **Reduce transparency**: Use fewer transparent elements
4. **Optimize images**: Use smaller, compressed textures
